# Credit Card Customer Growth & Engagement Analytics

## Problem Statement
Analyze credit card transaction data to understand customer engagement, spending behavior, and revenue contribution in order to support customer growth and retention decisions.

## Dataset
Transaction-level credit card data containing customer IDs, transaction amounts, dates, and spending categories. Multiple transactions exist per customer, requiring transformation to customer-level metrics.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, date formatting, normalization)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify spending and engagement patterns
3. Feature engineering to create customer-level metrics
4. SQL analysis for revenue contribution and category performance
5. KPI creation and interactive dashboarding in Power BI

## Key Metrics Created
- Total Spend per Customer
- Transaction Frequency
- Recency (days since last transaction)
- Revenue Contribution
- Active vs Inactive Customers

## Key Insights
- A small segment of customers contributes a large share of total revenue
- Inactive customers show declining transaction frequency and recency
- Certain spending categories drive higher and more consistent revenue

## Outcome
The project delivers actionable insights for customer engagement, retention, and revenue optimization through structured analysis and visualization.
